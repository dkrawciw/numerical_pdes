# numerical_pdes
Documenting work done for Numerical PDEs, a class led by Dr. Brennan Sprinkle from the Colorado School of Mines.

## Notes to self

I am using the python package manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). So, to run any of the bash scripts, that will need to be installed via `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.
