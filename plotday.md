# Plot Day Notes

I was afraid of deleting these notes so, I am putting them right here

## Plots that do really well

* A good plot looks good under any circumstances
* Don't do darkmode
* Label EVERY line
* Include units!
* Pick colorblind-friendly colors
* Make lines as thick as you can get away with
* For tick labels, make them obvious too
* Use the same font in figures as you do in your paper
    * Everyone knows about it and everyone cares about it

### Line etiquette
* Label EVERY line
* Pick colorblind-friendly colors
* Make lines as thick as you can get away with
* If two lines are over eachother
    * Maybe make one dashed - good but not the best thing ever
* Line markers
    * Line with no markers = function
    * Line of just markers = data collected
    * Line with Markers = Somewhere in between the two

### File Format
* Save as SVG - open source and uses vector graphics

### Error Plot Notes
* Use log scale for error plots
    * Gives information on the order of the error
